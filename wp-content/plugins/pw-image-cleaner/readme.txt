== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if the plugin reports an image that is actually still used? =

If you know an image is actively in use then don't delete it. We made PW Image Cleaner aware of some of the most widely used plugins, such as WooCommerce and many other top ranking plugins, but we can't guarantee every image discovered is definitely unused.
